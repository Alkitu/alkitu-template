## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES - MUST FOLLOW FOR EVERY CODE CHANGE

### Core Development Rules

1. **NEVER DELETE**: Do not delete ANY code until you are 100% certain it is not essential or being used elsewhere
2. **NEVER CREATE**: Do not create ANY new component/file until you verify a similar one doesn't already exist
3. **ALWAYS REUSE**: Always try to reuse existing code and update it when possible
4. **MAINTAIN COMPATIBILITY**: Any updates MUST be backward compatible - never break existing functionality
5. **COMMUNICATE FIRST**: Always explain what you're going to do BEFORE making any changes
6. **NO EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES**: Do NOT install any external dependencies unless EXTREMELY necessary

### Dependency Management Rules

- 🚫 **NEVER** install new packages without checking existing dependencies first
- 📦 **ALWAYS** review `package.json` files (root and all workspaces) before suggesting new dependencies
- ✅ **VERIFY** if functionality can be achieved with existing packages
- 🔍 **CHECK** all these locations before installing anything:
  - `/package.json` (root)
  - `/packages/api/package.json`
  - `/packages/web/package.json`
  - `/packages/mobile/package.json`
  - `/packages/shared/package.json`
- ⚠️ Only install new dependencies when absolutely no alternative exists

### Before Making ANY Changes

- ✅ Check if the component/function already exists
- ✅ Verify the code is not being used elsewhere
- ✅ Ensure changes are backward compatible
- ✅ Review existing dependencies before suggesting new ones
- ✅ Explain the planned changes to the user first
- ✅ Get confirmation before proceeding with significant changes

## 🛡️ THEME EDITOR SPECIFIC PROTECTION RULES

### DO NOT TOUCH - Critical System Components

These components are WORKING and must NOT be modified without explicit approval:

```typescript
// PROTECTED COMPONENTS - DO NOT MODIFY
❌ /core/context/ThemeEditorContext.tsx     // Central state management
❌ /core/types/theme.types.ts               // Type definitions used everywhere
❌ /lib/utils/color/color-conversions-v2.ts // Color conversion algorithms
❌ /lib/utils/css/css-variables.ts          // CSS variable application
❌ /layout/ResizableLayout.tsx              // Layout structure
```

### MUST PRESERVE - Working Functionality

These features are CURRENTLY WORKING and must remain functional:

```typescript
✅ Theme switching (light/dark mode)
✅ Color picker with OKLCH conversion
✅ Real-time preview updates
✅ Export functionality (CSS, JSON, Tailwind)
✅ Undo/Redo system (30 history entries)
✅ Theme persistence in localStorage
✅ Responsive viewport switching
```

### CAN MODIFY WITH CAUTION - Enhancement Areas

These areas can be modified BUT must maintain backward compatibility:

```typescript
⚠️ /design-system/atoms/*     // Can add tests, NOT modify interfaces
⚠️ /design-system/molecules/* // Can add tests, NOT modify props
⚠️ /design-system/organisms/* // Can add tests, NOT modify structure
⚠️ /preview/*                 // Can enhance, NOT break existing tabs
⚠️ /theme-editor/editor/*     // Can improve, NOT change data flow
```

## 🎯 OBJECTIVES BY DEVELOPMENT PHASE

### PHASE 0: Foundation & Setup ✅
**Objective**: Setup testing infrastructure WITHOUT breaking existing code
```typescript
MUST DO:
- Add Jest configuration alongside existing code
- Create test utilities in NEW files only
- Setup coverage reports without modifying source
- Add Storybook as SEPARATE concern

MUST NOT:
- Modify any existing component code
- Change import/export patterns
- Alter file structure
- Remove any existing functionality
```

### PHASE 1: Critical Path Testing 🧪
**Objective**: Add tests WITHOUT modifying component implementation
```typescript
MUST DO:
- Create *.test.tsx files alongside components
- Use existing component APIs as-is
- Test current functionality, not ideal functionality
- Document bugs found but DON'T fix yet

MUST NOT:
- Refactor components "to make them testable"
- Change component props or interfaces
- Add new props for testing purposes
- Modify state management
```

### PHASE 2: Accessibility Compliance ♿
**Objective**: Add accessibility WITHOUT breaking visual design
```typescript
MUST DO:
- ADD aria-labels to existing elements
- ADD keyboard handlers alongside mouse handlers
- ADD focus indicators via CSS only
- ADD screen reader announcements

MUST NOT:
- Change HTML structure for accessibility
- Modify existing event handlers
- Remove or replace existing interactions
- Change component hierarchy
```

### PHASE 3: Performance Optimization ⚡
**Objective**: Optimize WITHOUT changing functionality
```typescript
MUST DO:
- Add React.memo() as wrappers
- Add useMemo/useCallback to existing hooks
- Implement lazy loading at route level
- Add performance monitoring

MUST NOT:
- Restructure component tree
- Change state management pattern
- Modify data flow
- Replace working algorithms
```

### PHASE 4: Comprehensive Testing 🎯
**Objective**: Achieve 85% coverage WITHOUT refactoring
```typescript
MUST DO:
- Test edge cases of existing code
- Add integration tests for current flows
- Create E2E tests for actual user paths
- Setup visual regression for current UI

MUST NOT:
- Refactor to improve testability
- Change interfaces for better testing
- Modify component structure
- Alter business logic
```

### PHASE 5: Documentation & Polish 📚
**Objective**: Document existing system AS-IS
```typescript
MUST DO:
- Document current component APIs
- Create Storybook stories for existing props
- Write guides for current functionality
- Record videos of actual workflows

MUST NOT:
- Document ideal/future functionality
- Change APIs to match documentation
- Add features during documentation
- Modify behavior for consistency
```

### PHASE 6: Production Preparation 🚀
**Objective**: Prepare for production WITHOUT new features
```typescript
MUST DO:
- Optimize build configuration
- Add error boundaries around existing components
- Implement monitoring for current metrics
- Setup deployment for existing codebase

MUST NOT:
- Add "nice to have" features
- Refactor for "cleaner code"
- Change architecture patterns
- Modify core functionality
```

### PHASE 7: Standalone Migration 📦
**Objective**: Extract to package WITHOUT dependencies
```typescript
MUST DO:
- Copy existing code structure exactly
- Create abstraction layer for external deps
- Maintain exact same API surface
- Preserve all existing functionality

MUST NOT:
- Refactor during migration
- "Improve" code while extracting
- Change folder structure
- Modify import patterns
```

## 🔍 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST - RUN BEFORE EVERY CHANGE

### Pre-Change Verification
```bash
□ Did you check if this component/function already exists?
□ Did you search for similar implementations?
□ Did you verify no other component depends on this?
□ Did you check all package.json files for existing deps?
□ Did you test that current functionality still works?
```

### Post-Change Verification
```bash
□ Does theme switching still work?
□ Does color picker still update preview?
□ Does export still generate valid output?
□ Does undo/redo still function?
□ Do all existing tests still pass?
□ Is the UI visually unchanged?
```

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN ACTIONS - NEVER DO THESE

### Package Management
```bash
❌ npm install [any-new-package]      # Check existing first
❌ npm uninstall [any-package]        # May break dependencies
❌ npm update                          # Can break compatibility
❌ npm audit fix --force              # Can break versions
```

### Code Modifications
```typescript
❌ Deleting "unused" imports          // May be used dynamically
❌ Removing "dead" code               // May be used conditionally
❌ Refactoring "messy" code          // Focus on testing first
❌ Updating deprecated methods        // Maintain compatibility
❌ Changing file locations           // Breaks imports
❌ Renaming components               // Breaks references
```

### Git Operations
```bash
❌ git reset --hard                  # Loses work
❌ git push --force                  # Overwrites history
❌ git rebase                        # Can lose commits
❌ Committing without testing        # Breaks CI/CD
```

## 📞 CONTACT FOR APPROVAL

For any changes that require approval:
1. Document the proposed change
2. Explain why it's necessary
3. Show it won't break existing functionality
4. Get written approval before proceeding

---

**REMEMBER**: The goal is to make Theme Editor 3.0 production-ready WITHOUT breaking what already works. Every change must be additive, not destructive.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**: At the end of this project, EVERYTHING that works now must still work, PLUS have tests, accessibility, performance optimization, and documentation.
