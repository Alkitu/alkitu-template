### 🔄 Decision Lifecycle
1. **PROPOSED** - Initial decision documented
2. **UNDER_REVIEW** - Peer review in progress
3. **APPROVED** - Decision accepted and implemented
4. **REJECTED** - Decision not accepted
5. **SUPERSEDED** - Replaced by newer decision

## Implementation
1. Create `decisions/` directory in each ticket
2. Number decisions sequentially (DR-001, DR-002, etc.)
3. Link decisions in ticket documentation
4. Regular decision review sessions
5. Impact tracking and learning capture
