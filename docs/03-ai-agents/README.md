## üë• Agent Roles & Responsibilities

This project is built by a team of specialized AI agents. Each agent has a specific role and set of responsibilities to ensure a clear separation of concerns and a high degree of quality.

- **[Architecture Agent](./01-architecture-agent.md)**: Designs the system architecture, defines data models, and ensures SOLID principles are upheld.
- **[Testing Agent](./02-testing-agent.md)**: Implements and enforces our rigorous testing strategy, including TDD, mutation testing, and quality gates.
- **[Backend Agent](./03-backend-agent.md)**: Develops the NestJS-based backend, including APIs, services, and database integration.
- **[Frontend Agent](./04-frontend-agent.md)**: Builds the Next.js frontend, creating a responsive and intuitive user interface.
- **[Documentation Agent](./05-documentation-agent.md)**: Manages and maintains all project documentation, ensuring it is clear, accurate, and up-to-date.

For a complete overview of best practices that apply to all agents, please see our **[Best Practices Guide](./BEST-PRACTICES.md)**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Enhanced Workflow System

All agents must follow our comprehensive workflow system that includes health checks, peer reviews, impact analysis, and knowledge sharing.

### **[Enhanced Workflow Guide](./ENHANCED-WORKFLOW.md)**
Complete workflow system with pre-work validation, execution protocols, and post-work quality gates.

### **[Health Check System](./HEALTH-CHECK-TEMPLATE.md)**
System health validation before and after work to ensure environment stability.

### **[Peer Review Process](./PEER-REVIEW-SYSTEM.md)**
Cross-agent validation system for code quality, architecture decisions, and best practices.

### **[Impact Analysis](./IMPACT-ANALYSIS.md)**
Comprehensive change impact assessment to prevent unintended consequences.

### **[Decision Tracking](./DECISION-TRACKING.md)**
Systematic recording of all technical and architectural decisions with rationale.

### **[Knowledge Base](./KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md)**
Centralized repository of lessons learned, best practices, and solutions.

## üß™ Quality Assurance & Testing

Quality is paramount. All code must be developed following a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. 

### **[Complete Testing Strategy](../05-testing/README.md)**
Comprehensive testing strategy including TDD, mutation testing, and quality gates.

### **[CI/CD Workflow Guide](./ci-cd-workflow.md)**
Detailed instructions on continuous integration, deployment, and automated quality validation.

### **Quality Standards**
- **Line Coverage**: ‚â•95%
- **Branch Coverage**: ‚â•90%
- **Function Coverage**: ‚â•100%
- **Mutation Score**: ‚â•85%

## ü§ù Communication & Collaboration

Effective communication between agents is essential for project success.

### **Ticket Structure**
All tickets must follow the enhanced structure:
```
docs/04-product/tickets/[TICKET-ID]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Main ticket specification
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ health-check.md        # System health validation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ peer-review.md         # Cross-agent validation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ impact-analysis.md     # Change impact assessment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ decisions/             # Decision records
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ knowledge/             # Lessons learned
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ changes.md             # Change log
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ next-steps.md          # Handoff instructions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notes.md              # Working notes
```

### **Communication Protocol**
- **Daily Updates**: Share progress and blockers
- **Peer Reviews**: Mandatory for high-priority changes
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Document lessons learned
- **Decision Documentation**: Record all technical decisions

## üìö Documentation Standards

Clear and consistent documentation is critical for the success of this project. All agents are responsible for documenting their work according to the standards outlined in the main **[README.md](../../README.md)**.

### **Documentation Requirements**
- **Ticket Documentation**: Complete ticket structure for all work
- **Decision Records**: All technical decisions must be documented
- **Code Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation
- **Knowledge Capture**: Lessons learned and best practices
