## 🎯 Current Workflow Status

### **🔥 Active This Week** (2024-07-11 to 2024-07-18)

#### **Architecture Agent**

- **Active**: SOLID-001 ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Next**: SOLID-002 (OCP) - 🎯 **READY TO START**
- **Queue**: SOLID-003, SOLID-004, SOLID-005
- **Parallel Work**: Can continue SOLID principles while Backend Agent starts refactoring

#### **Backend Agent**

- **Active**: 📋 **WAITING** for handoff from Architecture Agent
- **Next**: REFACTOR-001 (UserService) - 🎯 **READY TO START**
- **Blocking**: Multiple tickets depend on UserService completion
- **Critical Path**: Has the most sequential dependencies

#### **Testing Agent**

- **Active**: 📋 **WAITING** for refactored services
- **Next**: TESTING-001 - ⏳ **BLOCKED** until REFACTOR-001 complete
- **Prep Work**: Can prepare test strategies and frameworks
- **Parallel Work**: Test planning while implementation happens

#### **Frontend Agent**

- **Active**: 📋 **WAITING** for backend completion
- **Next**: FRONTEND-001 - ⏳ **BLOCKED** until services refactored
- **Prep Work**: Can analyze current API usage patterns
- **Parallel Work**: Planning integration strategy

#### **Documentation Agent**

- **Active**: ✅ **COORDINATING** - Managing workflow and quality systems
- **Continuous**: Dashboard updates, handoff coordination
- **Quality Systems**: Health checks, peer reviews, knowledge capture

## 📊 Dependency Chain Analysis

### **🔴 Critical Path** (Longest sequence, determines project timeline)

```
SOLID-001 ✅ → REFACTOR-001 🎯 → TESTING-001 📋 → FRONTEND-001 📋
   (Done)    (Next - 4-5h)    (Blocked)      (Blocked)
```

### **⚡ Parallel Opportunities**

```
SOLID-002/003/004/005 (Architecture Agent)
    ↓ (Can work in parallel)
REFACTOR-001 (Backend Agent)
    ↓ (Sequential dependency)
TESTING-001 (Testing Agent)
    ↓ (Sequential dependency)
FRONTEND-001 (Frontend Agent)
```

### **🚨 Bottleneck Analysis**

1. **REFACTOR-001** is blocking 3 other agents' critical work
2. **Backend Agent** has 7 sequential refactoring tickets
3. **UserService refactoring** specifically blocks testing and frontend
4. **Service refactoring phase** is the longest duration

2. **Update next-day priorities** and dependencies
3. **Document any blockers** or issues
4. **Prepare handoffs** for next agents

### **Agent Handoff Protocol**

1. ✅ **Complete all 4 files**: README, next-steps, notes, changes
2. ✅ **Update ticket status** in PROJECT-DASHBOARD.md
3. ✅ **Notify next agent** with specific handoff instructions
4. ✅ **Document any decisions** in decision tracking system
5. ✅ **Capture lessons learned** in knowledge base

#### **When Starting a Ticket**

1. 🔍 **Review dependencies** and prerequisites
2. 🔍 **Read handoff documentation** from previous agent
3. 🔍 **Confirm understanding** of requirements and approach
4. 🔍 **Update status** to "IN PROGRESS"
5. 🔍 **Begin implementation** following TDD methodology

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### **Weekly Velocity Targets**

- **Week 1** (Architecture): 5 SOLID tickets + 1 refactoring = 6 tickets
- **Week 2** (Refactoring): 4-5 refactoring tickets
- **Week 3** (Testing): 4 testing/validation tickets
- **Week 4** (Frontend): 3 frontend tickets

### **Current Progress vs Target**

- **Planned Week 1**: 6 tickets
- **Actual Week 1**: 1 ticket (SOLID-001) + planning
- **Week 1 Status**: ✅ **ON TRACK** (includes comprehensive planning)

### **Risk Mitigation**

- **Backend Overload**: Architecture Agent can assist with design decisions
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Maximize parallel work where possible
- **Timeline Pressure**: Focus on critical path, defer non-blocking items
- **Quality Risk**: Maintain 95%+ test coverage throughout all changes
