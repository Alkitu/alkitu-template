# Next Steps - SOLID-001

## ðŸš€ Recommendations for Next Agent

_This file will be completed by the Architecture Agent upon task completion_

### Immediate Next Actions:

- [ ] **Backend Agent** should begin REFACTOR-001 implementation
- [ ] Focus on UserService refactoring applying SRP
- [ ] Implement single responsibility separation
- [ ] Create specific service interfaces

### Updated Files Ready for Implementation:

```markdown
## Ready for Backend Agent:

- [ ] `packages/api/src/users/users.service.ts` - Main service to refactor
- [ ] `packages/api/src/users/interfaces/` - New interfaces directory
- [ ] `packages/api/src/users/dto/` - Updated DTOs for SRP

## Implementation Priority:

1. Split UserService responsibilities - Extract separate services
2. Create specific interfaces for each responsibility
3. Update dependency injection patterns
4. Refactor tests to match new structure
```

### Architecture Decisions Made:

```markdown
## Key Decisions:

- [ ] **Decision 1**: Separate UserService into multiple focused services
      **Rationale**: Follow SRP by having each service handle one responsibility
      **Impact**: Better maintainability and testability

- [ ] **Decision 2**: Create specific interfaces for each service
      **Rationale**: Enable better dependency injection and testing
      **Impact**: Improved code quality and SOLID compliance

- [ ] **SOLID Compliance**: Applied Single Responsibility Principle
      **Patterns Used**: Service separation, Interface segregation
      **Benefits**: More maintainable and testable code
```

### Potential Blockers for Next Agent:

```markdown
## Possible Issues:

- [ ] **Issue**: Existing code dependencies on monolithic UserService
      **Impact**: Breaking changes to existing implementations
      **Mitigation**: Gradual refactoring with backward compatibility
      **Priority**: HIGH

- [ ] **Issue**: Test coverage maintenance during refactoring
      **Impact**: Potential coverage drop during transition
      **Mitigation**: Refactor tests incrementally
      **Priority**: MEDIUM
```

### Implementation Results:

```markdown
## Completion Status:

- [ ] âœ… SRP analysis completed
- [ ] âœ… Service separation strategy defined
- [ ] âœ… Interface definitions created
- [ ] âœ… Refactoring plan documented
- [ ] âœ… SOLID compliance strategy established

## Quality Metrics Achieved:

- **SOLID Compliance**: SRP strategy defined
- **Architecture**: Service separation pattern established
- **Documentation**: Refactoring guidelines created
```

### Configuration & Setup for Next Agent:

````markdown
## Environment Setup:

- [ ] **Dependencies**: No new dependencies required
- [ ] **Configuration**: Service registration patterns updated
- [ ] **Database**: No schema changes needed
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: No new env vars needed

## Commands to Run:

```bash
# Commands the next agent should run
npm run test # To verify current state
npm run lint # To check code quality
npm run dev # To start development
```
````

### Recommended Agent Queue Update:

```markdown
## Next Execution Order:

1. **Backend Agent** (HIGH priority) - REFACTOR-001
   - **Focus**: UserService refactoring applying SRP
   - **Dependencies**: SOLID-001 architectural decisions
   - **Estimated Duration**: 3-4 hours

2. **Testing Agent** (MEDIUM priority) - TEST-001
   - **Focus**: Update tests for new service structure
   - **Dependencies**: REFACTOR-001 completion
   - **Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours

3. **Documentation Agent** (LOW priority) - DOC-002
   - **Focus**: Update API documentation
   - **Dependencies**: REFACTOR-001 and TEST-001
   - **Estimated Duration**: 1-2 hours
```

### Knowledge Transfer:

```markdown
## Important Context for Next Agent:

- **Key Learning**: SRP requires careful analysis of existing responsibilities
- **Best Practice**: Start with interfaces before implementation
- **Gotcha**: Maintain backward compatibility during refactoring
- **Resource**: SOLID principles documentation in best-practices.md

## Code Patterns Established:

- **Pattern 1**: Single-purpose service classes with specific interfaces
- **Pattern 2**: Dependency injection with interface segregation
- **Convention**: Service naming convention: [Entity][Responsibility]Service
```
