# 📋 User Management System - Requirements and Acceptance Criteria

## 🎯 **Functional Requirements**

### **R1: User Listing**
**Priority**: High
**Description**: Display a list of all registered users with key information.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Users are listed with their name, email, and role.
- ✅ The list is paginated with 20 users per page.
- ✅ Users can be sorted by name, email, or creation date.
- ⚠️ The list updates in real-time if new users are registered. (API provides data, real-time update is frontend responsibility and not directly implemented in backend API).

### **R2: User Detail View**
**Priority**: High
**Description**: Provide a detailed view for each user, accessible by clicking on a user from the list.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Displays all user information (name, email, role, creation date, last login, etc.).
- ✅ Allows editing of user information (name, role).
- ✅ Provides an option to reset user password (admin only). (Implemented as admin-initiated password reset with temporary password).
- ✅ Provides an option to deactivate/activate user account (admin only). (Implemented via status update).

### **R3: User Creation**
**Priority**: High
**Description**: Allow administrators to create new user accounts.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Administrators can input new user's name, email, and initial role.
- ⚠️ System sends an email to the new user with temporary password or account activation link. (Currently sends a generic welcome notification via `NotificationService`, not a specific email with credentials or activation link).
- ✅ Input fields have proper validation (e.g., valid email format, unique email).

### **R4: User Search and Filtering**
**Priority**: Medium
**Description**: Enable efficient searching and filtering of users.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Users can be searched by name or email.
- ✅ Users can be filtered by role (e.g., Admin, Editor, Viewer).
- ✅ Filters can be combined with search queries.
- ✅ URL reflects applied filters and search terms.

### **R5: Role Management**
**Priority**: High
**Description**: Allow administrators to manage user roles and permissions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Administrators can assign/change roles for existing users.
- ✅ Role changes are applied immediately.
- ❌ System ensures at least one administrator account always exists. (This validation is not explicitly implemented in the backend).

### **R6: Audit Log**
**Priority**: Medium
**Description**: Maintain a log of significant user-related actions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ❌ Logs user creation, updates, deactivations, and role changes. (No formal audit logging system is implemented).
- ❌ Each log entry includes timestamp, action, and the administrator who performed it.
- ❌ Audit logs are accessible only to administrators.

## 🎯 **Non-Functional Requirements**

### **RNF1: Performance**
- Initial load time for user list < 2 seconds.
- Search and filter operations respond within 500ms.
- System supports up to 10,000 users without significant performance degradation.

### **RNF2: Security**
- All user management operations require administrator authentication.
- Role-based access control is enforced for all actions.
- Password reset functionality is secure (e.g., token-based). (Admin-initiated reset is secure; user-initiated token-based reset is handled by Auth module, not User module).
- Sensitive user data is encrypted at rest.

### **RNF3: Usability**
- Intuitive interface for managing users.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Clear feedback for all user actions (e.g., success messages, error messages).

### **RNF4: Scalability**
- Architecture supports horizontal scaling for increased user base.
- Database queries for user data are optimized with appropriate indexing.

## 📝 **Implementation Notes**

### Current System Status
- ✅ **Authentication**: Existing authentication system can be leveraged for admin roles.
- ✅ **Database**: Prisma is already in use for database interactions.
- ✅ **Backend API**: Core user management functionalities (CRUD, search, filter, bulk operations, password change) are implemented in `UsersService` and exposed via `UsersController`.
- ⚠️ **Frontend Implementation**: The frontend components for user listing and detail views are described in tickets but their actual implementation status needs to be verified in the `packages/web` directory.
- ❌ **Audit Logging**: A dedicated audit logging system for user actions is not implemented.
- ❌ **Admin Account Validation**: There is no explicit validation to ensure at least one ADMIN account always exists.
